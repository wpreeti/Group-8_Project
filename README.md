# House Price Index Analysis Project

--- 

For this project, we analyzed the House Price Index (HPI) provided by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). As per the FHFA, the HPI is a broad indicator of single-family house price trends at various geographic levels. The HPI can offer insights about house price fluctuations ranging from broader national level to very concise cencus tract level. We took a deeper dive into the Finance and Real Estate industries using the HPI dataset to uncover trends and insights from the HPI based on location in the U.S.

### Questions we will ask of the data:

- Are there any patterns or fluctuations in HPI based on region? How do the different regions compare?
- What is the trend in HPI pre-COVID, and to what degree did it change during COVID?
- Is there any correlation between HPI and CPI (Inflation) on a national level? What conclusions can we draw from the comparison?

### Source for the data:

Our House Price Index data will come from the [FHFA website](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx). We will be utilizing the Master HPI Data which appends quarterly and monthly data. Additionally, we will be utilizing the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index dataset to answer our correlation questions. Specifically, we will utilize the [U.S. City Average, All items](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm) to gain a more broad understanding of the CPI.
