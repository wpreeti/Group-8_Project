## __Group 8 Project 1 Proposal__

--- 

### __The kind of data we’d like to work with and the field we’re interested in:__

For this project, we will be analyizng the House Price Index (HPI) provided by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). As per the FHFA, the HPI is a broad indicator of single-family house price trends at various geographic levels. The HPI can offer insights about house price fluctuations ranging from broader national level to very concise cencus tract level. We are interested in taking a deeper dive into the Finance and Real Estate industries using the HPI dataset because we want to take advantage of the level of transparency and accuracy a federal agency is required to maintain. With this, we believe we will be able to draw some very concise, acute conclusions based on our analysis of the dataset.

### __Questions we will ask of the data:__

- Is there any correlation between HPI and CPI/Inflation on a national level? On a city level?
- 

### __Source for the data:__

Our House Price Index data will come from the [FHFA website](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx). We will be utilizing the Master HPI Data which appends quarterly and monthly data. Additionally, we will be utilizing the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index dataset to answer our correlation questions. Specifically, we will utilize the [U.S. City Average, All items](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm) to gain a more broad understanding of the CPI.
